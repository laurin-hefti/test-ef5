Stockanlyser is an Application for just getting Information daily about a spesific Stock.

The Program has to run somewehre, doesent matter who, the only reqirement is, that it needs acces to 
internet. Once the programm is running, no changes in the programm are needed.

Wath is the Programm doeing?
The program sends you daily an email with Information about the Stock you can choose. The Informations are:
open, close, higth, low, dif and p. The first four Infromation, are stait forward, the dif ist the
difference between the start and the end of the day. The p stands for percentage and shows how much the 
Value have changet, with respect to the Total Value. In other words the persentage of change but decimal 
values. So 0% is 0 and 100% is 1. The timerange is one day and the Values are from the day bevore. This
is because, to have acces on current Infromation about the Stock, you need the premium version, how is
not free.

How can I modify the Program?
If you want to make any changes on the Program, you can do this with sending an email back to the
stockanalyser. The emailadress is: stockanlyser2@web.de. 
The mail as to follow some rules. If you want to change something, you have to write a "execute:",
note is must be lower case, and then write wath you want to change.
There are three differen things you can change.
First ist not realy a change. If you want to have now the information you can wirte:
"execute: send".
In the next minutes it will send the Infromation, not immediately. This is because, it has to interact
with the mail server and it will probably block the program, if it asks all 10 sekonds if someting arrived.
The seccond changing is, wenn you want to change the stock, default is SMI.
This can be done with "execute: stock". As the stock word you fill in the stock name. If the stock name
is not correct, the programm will send you a missleading message by the next letter you get. Something like
the stock is currently on the weekend. This is the samme message you get, wenn the stock is realy in the 
weekend.
My you are not the ony one how wants to get the Information about the stock. You can easily add other
emailaddresses on wicht a mail should be sended. This is easily done by writing: "execute: name@name.ch".
Note if you no longer wanth to recieve emails, you can add a - sing bevore your email address and send
it to the server.


If no longer emails are comming, then something went wrong with the programm. It should be resistent cause the
individual processes are paralellised with multythreading, so if something went wrong, the main program
should be continnuing. It could be thath the mail server is blockt, cause he thinks the programm is a violent
acces and it prohibit the acces on the mailserver. But thes problems are for the administrator.

We use the polygon.oi api for the information and the web.de mailserver for the mails.
